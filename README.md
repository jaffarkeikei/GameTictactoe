# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic tic-tac-toe game in C. The game is played in the console, where two players take turns to make their moves on a 3x3 grid. The goal of the game is for a player to get three of their marks (either 'X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal.

## How to Play
1. Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
2. Run the compiled executable in your console.
3. Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row (0-2) and column (0-2) they want to place their mark.
4. The game will display the updated board after each move.
5. The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
6. If no player achieves three marks in a row and the entire grid is filled, the game ends in a tie.

## Features
- The game initializes with an empty 3x3 grid.
- Players can only place their mark ('X' or 'O') in an empty spot on the grid.
- The game checks for a winning condition after each move and declares a winner if one is found.
- If the grid is filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory where the compiled executable is located.
3. Run the executable.
4. Follow the prompts to enter your moves and play the game.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide a more user-friendly gaming experience.
- Allow players to choose their marks ('X' or 'O') at the beginning of the game.
- Implement an AI opponent for single-player mode.
- Add a scoring system to keep track of the number of games won by each player.
